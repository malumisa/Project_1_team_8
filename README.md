# Project 1: Changing Behaviours During the COVID-19 Pandemic
## Team #8 - Using Data Analytics to Evaluate Behaviours

## Abstract
The coronavirus pandemic left a huge impact on every aspect of human life.  The project's objective is to provide both an overview and details of how behviours changed relative to spending and approaches to education in Canada, comparing population and economic data both before and during the pandemic.  

To carry out the research and evaluation, several data sources were pooled, including census data from 2016 and 2021, consumer spending data across a variety of consumer goods, as well as enrolment in alternative education streams (ie. MOOCS).  Analysis will be undertaken as to how these may have changed during this time frame.  The data will be examined in correlation to the demographic and socioeconmic makeup of the Canadian population.  

## Next steps
Data on consumer spending and educational and demographic makeup will be consolidated to draw comparative inferences to identify whether any correlations can be drawn.

## Research Questions
* Defining a comparison of the Canadian socioeconomic profile before and during the pandemic.
* Did Canadians spend more money relative to their income both before and after?
* In what commodities did Canadians spend more? (ie. education, consumer goods, food, etc.)
* Are there indicators that show a correlation between changing behaviours before and after the pandmeic.
